### Problem Solving Strategies
1) Understand the problem
    * Can you restate the problem in your own words?
    * What are the inputs?
    * What are the outputs?
    * Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do you have enough information to solve the problem?
    * How should you label important pieces of data?
3) Explore examples
    * Start with simple examples
    * Progress to more complex examples
    * Explore empty inputs (or edge cases)
    * What about invalid inputs
4) Break it down
    * Explicitly write out the steps
6) Solve/Simplify
    * Solve simpler or parts of the problem
9) Look back and refactor
    * Check the result
    * Can you understand it?
    * Can you improve performance?
    * Ask for different approaches - how did other people solve it?

### Big O Notation
Big O Notation is the mtric we use to describe and compare the efficiency of algorithms.

*Time Complexity*

*Space Complexity*
